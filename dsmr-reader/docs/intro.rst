Project mission & goals
-----------------------
- Provide an easy to use setup for logging your own energy consumption.
- Keeping your data for yourself (all data is stored locally and untracked as well).
- Always free to use (it's open source on Github as well).


Why?
----
Because open-source triggers the community to collaborate even more and bring out the best ideas! In the last year, many other cool DSMR-projects were launched as well! 


Languages
---------
The entire application and it's code is written in English. The interface is also translated into Dutch and will be triggered depending on your browser's language preference.


Skill
-----
The project is well documented, but requires a certain 'Unix skill' as you will need to install several dependencies using the command line.

I advise to only use this tool when you have basic Linux knowledge or have any interest in the components used.


Github
