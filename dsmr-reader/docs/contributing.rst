Pull requests
-------------
Pull requests are appreciated, but please note that you should discuss any changes with a Github ticket first. 
It would be a shame if you'd put any effort in something that won't get merged after all.

Also, please do not create pull requests for the ``master`` branch, but always point it to ``development``.
